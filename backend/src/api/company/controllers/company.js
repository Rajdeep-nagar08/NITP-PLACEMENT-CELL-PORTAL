/**
 *  company controller
 */


/*

@rajdeep

This is a Node.js code written in the Strapi framework. 
It defines a custom controller for the 'company' entity 
that performs additional operations before saving a new company 
record to the database. The code uses the Strapi factory function createCoreController
 to create a new controller, and exports the resulting object.

The custom controller has one method register which handles
 the creation of a new company record. The method starts by checking
  that the request body contains data, and returns a 'bad request' error 
  if it does not. The method then sets the 'status' attribute to "pending" 
  (since it's not yet approved) and calls the built-in create method to save the new record to the database.

The register method provides a custom way to create company records that
 ensures that the records are created with a 'status' of 'pending' and 
 performs additional validation before saving to the database.
