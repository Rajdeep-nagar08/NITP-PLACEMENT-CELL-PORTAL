     * Helper function to check if a student is eligible for a job
     * 
     * @param {Student} student Student data
     * @param {Job} job Job object which has to be checked 
     * @param {[Application]} selected_applications
     * - Array of applications, for which "the current student" has already been selected
     * 
     * @notes
     * - IMPORTANT NOTE: Must check for job_status before calling this function
     *   This is because admin requires that this returns true even if job_status:closed
     * - All parameters are mandatory
     * - Some fields in student collection are relations, so they need to be populated,
     *   eg. student.course
     * - selected_applications should contain "all" applications for which the student has
     *   already been selected, irrespective of any other condition, eg. FTE/Internship
     *   Example:
     *       const selected_applications = await strapi.db.query("api::application.application").findMany({
     *         where: {
     *             student: id,
     *             status: "selected"
     *         },
     *         populate: ["job"]
     *       });
     * 
     * @assumptions
     * - job.eligible_courses is a string of comma-separated course IDs, eg. "1,2,5"
     * - job status terminology:
     *   - "open" - job is open for new applications
     *   - "ongoing" - no more applications, selection in process for older ones
     *   - "results_declared" - no more applications, results are declared
     *   - "abandoned" - no more applications, job is abandoned
     * 
     * @checks
     * To be eligible for a job:
     * - job minimum marks are less than or equal to student's marks, X, XII, CPI
     * - job is eligible for student's course
     * - job category matches student's registerd_for category, eg. Internship/FTE
     * - job is approved by admin
     * - job start datetime is less than current datetime
     * - job last datetime is greater than current datetime
     * - job is not already applied by student
     * - If job.only_for_ews, then only EWS students are eligible
     * - If job.only_for_pwd, then only PWD students are eligible
     * - If job.only_for_female, then only Female students are eligible
     * - If already selected in an "Internship" then ineligible for other "Internships"
     *
     * More conditions for "FTE" Jobs based on past applications:
     * - 1. If job.classification is "X", then the 'below' 3 conditions will be null and void
     * - 2. If selected in X or A1 => out of placement, not eligible (clarification: any number of times, because the below conditions don't apply)
     * - 3. If selected in A2, then 3 more A1 applications allowed, AFTER selected in A2
     * - 4. If student receives 2 offers, not eligible for more applications
     *
     * Note: The above checks will also include considering the "placed_status" in student
     *
     * @returns {boolean} If the student is eligible, this will return true
